##Bia's notes - final project

Using Galaxy to do RNA-Seq Assemble  
Data from the study is at [this NCBI GEO page](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE17274)  
There is a total of 36 files (human, chimp, rhesus/male1, male2, female1, female2/rep1, rep2)  
The group decided to divide these 36 files among us (9 files each) to start the assemble  
I am responsible for files 28-36, which corresponds to:  
-GSM432625	Rhesus female 2 rep2
-GSM432626	Rhesus female 3 rep1
-GSM432627	Rhesus female 3 rep2
-GSM432628	Rhesus male 1 rep1
-GSM432629	Rhesus male 1 rep2
-GSM432630	Rhesus male 2 rep1
-GSM432631	Rhesus male 2 rep2
-GSM432632	Rhesus male 3 rep1
-GSM432633	Rhesus male 3 rep2     

###To collect the data  
1. Galaxy>Get Data > EBI SRA  
2. Searched for "GSE17274"  
3. Clicked on "Submission(Read/Analysis) - SRA010277  
4. Clicked on designated files, getting them in FASTQ format directly into Galaxy (FASTQ files (Galaxy))
